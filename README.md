# Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Project

## Overview
This project implements a basic Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system that monitors endpoints for suspicious activity. The EDR system consists of a client-side agent that collects data from endpoints and a server that analyzes the data for potential threats.

## Features
- **Agent Monitoring**: Collects running processes and network activity from endpoints.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies suspicious processes and network connections.
- **Alert Logging**: Stores alerts in a JSON file for later review.
- **Web Dashboard**: Displays alerts and logs through a simple web interface.

## Architecture
- **Agent**: Python script installed on each endpoint.
- **Server**: Flask application that receives data from agents and performs analysis.
- **Dashboard**: Flask-based web application to visualize alerts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Requests
- Basic knowledge of networking and security concepts

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/edr-project.git
cd edr-project
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install Flask requests
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Server
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the server directory.
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

### Step 4: Set Up the Agent
1. Open another terminal and navigate to the agent directory.
2. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python agent.py
   ```

### Step 5: Access the Dashboard
- Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:5001/` to view the dashboard.

## Configuration
- Update the `SERVER_URL` variable in `agent.py` to point to your server's IP address if not running locally.

## Usage
- The agent will send endpoint data to the server every 60 seconds.
- The server will analyze the data and log any detected anomalies.
- The dashboard will display all alerts for review.
